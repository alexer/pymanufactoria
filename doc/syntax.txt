'#' starts a comment.
Empty lines are ignored.
Every line has the format "label cmd args".
Execution is started on first line.
Commands are j, jrb, jyg, and w.
- j TARGET:
  * continue execution at label TARGET
- jrb RED BLUE [OTHER]:
- jyg YELLOW GREEN [OTHER]:
  * read tape, continue execution at label <COLOR> or OTHER depending on if a <color> or a different symbol was read
  * OTHER defaults to REJECT
- w COLORS TARGET:
  * write COLORS to tape and continue execution at label TARGET
Jump targets are labels, REJECT and ACCEPT (and ASSERT) are special labels that end execution with the respective status.
