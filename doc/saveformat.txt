Save data contains components separated by a semicolon.
Components have the format "TX:YfD", where:
- T = component type
- X and Y = component coordinates
- D = component orientation
Coordinates start from x=6,y=1 at the top left corner. (on a large field)
Entry is at 12:1, starting position at 12:2 and exit at 12:13.
Component types are:
- b, r, g and y: writers for blue, red, green and yellow, respectively
- p and q: branches for red-blue and green-yellow, respectively
- c and i: belts, single and bridged, respectively
Basic directions are:
- 0=left 1=up 2=right 3=down
For branches, the "other" branch points to the orientation of the component,
"red" and "green" are to the left and "blue" and "yellow" to the right.
These can also be flipped, in which case the directions are:
- 4=left 5=up 6=right 7=down
Directions for crossed belts are: (first one visually on the bottom and second one on the top)
- 0=up+left 1=down+left 2=left+up 3=right+up 4=up+right 5=down+right 6=left+down 7=right+down
